# SHADOWBB8
James Bruton's BB8 controller code converted to SHADOW code for use with PS3 Navigation controllers (pair).
This code is a work in progress, although all functions have been implemented.  

Further work will entail:
1. Add Disco Droid control mappings to button combinations for sounds
2. Add Ps3 sixaxis controller configuration
3. Add PS4 sixaxis controller configuration
4. add mp3trigger controls
5. Add Dome Automation routines

NOTE: This is my personal code for S.H.A.D.O.W. (Small Handheld Arduino Droid Operating Wand) that I use to control my BB8 droid.
